# Encryption_Decryption
Developed a programme that allows us to encrypt and decrypt private messages.

Transforming plain text data (plaintext) into something that appears random and meaningless is the process of encryption (ciphertext).
High security and privacy are provided by encryption when we communicate, send messages, or share any private information on social media.
Let's use an example: We can't trust any messenger if I want to share your bank account password or any other type of legal pin or code. But what would happen if these messages were encrypted. If so, nobody will be able to read or even understand this.

Now Decryption
The process of turning encrypted text back to plain text is known as decryption.
Therefore, if a person has this software and a password, they can readily open it.
Keep privacy and feel secure when sending communications.


Cryptography is a means of securing information and communications by using codes, ensuring that only those for whom the information is meant can read and interpret it. Encryption and decryption fall under this category.
